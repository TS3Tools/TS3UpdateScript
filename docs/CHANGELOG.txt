==================================
||      Version 3.8             ||
==================================

* Adjusted detection for installed TeamSpeak server version, build and platform
+ Added "Build" string to summary output
+ Added support for ignoring all clients of given servergroup ids for parameter '--inform-online-clients' (enter sgid in configs/ignore_servergroups.txt)
! You have to create this file, if it does not exists
+ Added support for new dbPlugin 'MariaDB'
! Since TeamSpeak server version 3.0.11 (Build 1408694433) was the MySQL database replaced by the fork MariaDB (read CHANGELOG of TeamSpeak server version 3.0.11 and newer)
! If the script is updating from version 3.0.10.3 (Build 1388593719) to 3.0.11 or newer, it also will update your MySQL database to MariaDB
+ If MySQL/MariaDB database is used, the script will also detect the database username, password and database (used for updates and database fixes)
! Add your IP address, which is used for connecting as ServerQuery to query_ip_whitelist.txt or the script is may not able to detect your installed version, because it is banned by the server
! Do not check to often the same instance or you will get banned by the instance!

==================================
||      Version 3.7             ||
==================================

+ Added parameter(s) '-v' / '--version' to display the version of the script
+ Added parameter '--autoupdate-script' for full automate update process of your TS3UpdateScript - excluding configs/
+ Added support for two new parameters for su-command, if you execute the script with non-root permissions
* Updated cronjob installer for supporting all parameters
*/- Removed second needed parameter 'latestStableVersion.txt' for parameter '--latest-version'; it will use the version of configs/latestStableVersion.txt
! If you have used this feature in past, just remove the parameter to the file
* Changed text "Installing new cronjob" to "Installing new cronjob in '/etc/cron.d/TS3UpdateScript'" as hint for finding the cronjob file
! Updated docs/UPDATE_GUIDE.txt
! Updated docs/INSTALL_USAGE_GUIDE.txt

==================================
||      Version 3.6.3           ||
==================================

* Deleted first/standard password-file; it will now created with a stream redirection instead of coping the file
* Changed donation link
! Extended README.md
+ --help: Added 'You may will test the latest version first' to parameter '--latest-version'
* Renamed parameter '--check-for-update' to '--update-script'
* Changed && to ||, to accept 'y' and 'yes' as answer for the script update
+ Added facebook fanpage to header of script
* Temp-file 'auto_update_text.txt' was created in root directory of TS3UpdateScript, but not deleted
* Fixed non-working script update
* Set raw-GitHub link for better searching for the latest script version
* Outsourced TS3UpdateScript update mechnism to own script: .updateScript.sh
! ATTENTION: Do *NOT* execute the script manually - it's your own risk! Use instead ./TS3UpdateScript.sh --update-script

==================================
||      Version 3.5.1           ||
==================================

! No code was changed! Be sure, that you've installed the package 'ca-certificates' for fetching the latest script version - for further details execute 'apt-cache show ca-certificates'

==================================
||      Version 3.5             ||
==================================

* Replaced Shebang '/bin/bash' with '/usr/bin/env bash' to make it more portable
* Fixed issue with DDoS-Protection of TeamSpeak - the script is now able to identify the latest version (replaced teamspeak.com with teamspeak.de)
* Changed download mirror from 'files.teamspeak-services.com' to 'dl.4players.de' for server files (reason: files.teamspeak-services.com does not exists anymore)
+ Added check, if a TeamSpeak server is installed anyway
*/! Changed default eMail address of 'displayed_user_name.txt', because I've received very much eMails from other servers, which are not owned by me (I've deleted all eMails)
+ Added '7. Debugging' part to 'INSTALL_USAGE_GUIDE.txt'
+ Added parameter '--latest-version' - if you are a hoster and want to test the latest version first, you are now able to say the script, that you specify the latest version (just write the version string in a file and tell the script, that you want to us it. Example: ./TS3UpdateScript.sh --check --delete-old-logs --inform-online-clients --latest-version /home/demoLab/latestStableVersion.txt)
* Adjusted Backup/Rollback feature - you could now run more than one TS3UpdateScript.sh process at the same time, because the backups are saved under '/tmp/ts3server_backup/root/of/installed/ts_server/'
+ Added parameter '--keep-backups' - if you don't want that the script deletes the backup of your server, you are now able to say this the script
* Changed file structure (view README.txt for details)
* '--help' and '-h' are now the same section in code -> reduced the code of the script
* Removed link to forum, because I received all bug reports and suggestions via eMail (forum was deleted)
* Changed mail@ts3-tools.info to info@ts3-tools.info everywhere
* Adjusted '--help' output, because some output was overwritten
* Fixed check for latest version of TS3 UpdateScript self, because the old link is not longer available

==================================
||      Version 3.4             ||
==================================

* Fixed non-working update feature for the script self
! Tried to fetch the version via the ServerQuery command 'version' but this will take 4 seconds more than analyzing the log file of the instance
! Do you have any further suggestions or bugs? Write me an eMail to mail@ts3-tools.info or open a new topic in the forum: http://www.forum.ts3-tools.info/

==================================
||      Version 3.3             ||
==================================

* Fixed issue with variable "TERM" from Cronjob
+ Added status "In Progress" to the actual todo of the script: [ .. ] -> [ OK ] or [ FAILED ]
* Changed example E-Mail address from file 'administrator_eMail.txt'
! Please set your OWN E-Mail address! I don't want to receive your E-Mails. ;)
! HINT: If you change the E-Mail(s) from file 'administrator_eMail.txt', you have to reinstall your cronjob!
! Set more emails like following: you@domain.com,yourPartner@example.com,me@ts3.de
* Changed script selfcheck: At first check, if the script is running as root and then check the parameters
* Changed example text of "auto_update_text.txt" file
* Adjusted update feature of the script self: it will now also not update the files 'administrator_eMail.txt' and 'ignore_clients.txt'
* Adjusted output of script (especially for cronjob)
+ Added length check for displayed username (just 30 chars are allowed)
* Moved length checks higher
- Removed "tempfile" for Debian based systems (each system will use 'mktemp' now)
* Moved 'Searching for latest TeamSpeak 3 server version' higher to adjust the progress of the script especially for the length checks

==================================
||      Version 3.2             ||
==================================

* Adjusted update feature for the script (it will show you, if a newer version is available; you need to execute './TS3UpdateScript.sh --check-for-update' to update the script)
* Adjusted checks for given parameters (you are now able to set the parameters in an order like you want)
! You need to replace the '=' with a 'space' in parameters, which are using it. For example: Instead "./TS3UpdateScript.sh --autoupdate=no" use "./TS3UpdateScript.sh --autoupdate no"
! You can use each parameter in each order ;)
- Removed not needed code, cause of adjusted parameter checks
* Adjusted output of "help" page: './TS3UpdateScript.sh --help' or './TS3UpdateScript.sh -h'
+ Added E-Mail function: Cronjob will send you an E-Mail with the output of the script
! To use the E-Mail function, you have to provide your E-Mail address in following file: administrator_eMail.txt
* Adjusted cronjob - it is an own file now (/etc/cron.d/TS3UpdateScript) and will not edit your existing cronjob/crontab file of root
+ Added functionality to ignore given clients for poke messages
! Please provide the 'client_database_id' of each client, which should be ignored for pokes in following file: ignore_clients.txt (each line should contain one id)
* Adjusted output of starting the "TSDNS server"

==================================
||      Version 3.1	        ||
==================================

* Fixed issue with deleting old logs, if '--autoupdate=yes' is used
- Removed old software check code
* Fixed length issue for update text check
* Set new donations url
+ Added UID and GID to output summary
* Adjusted checks for empty variables ('-n' instead of '!= ""')
* Removed parameter 'password-file'; File 'password-file' will be used, if '--inform-online-clients' is set as parameter
! Do not rename the 'password-file' file
! Adjusted INSTALL_USAGE_GUIDE.txt in case of no needed 'password-file' file
* Adjusted software/package checks: 'telnet' will just be checked, if '--inform-online-clients' is set
* Adjusted update feature for the script itself - autoupdate will now also check for latest version, but will just show the information
* Moved code for searching the latest TeamSpeak 3 server version a bit higher, that it can be used for some other code
+ Added support for update texts: You are now able to use the variable $VERSION to display the latest TeamSpeak 3 server version
! An example for the update text is shown in the default text file and in the INSTALL_USAGE_GUIDE.txt
* Adjusted each output text: You will now see, what the script is doing and the script will write on the right side of your screen the status "OK", "FAILED", "ERROR" or "INFO"
- Removed duplicate code
- Removed unused code, which was commented
* Moved "Searching for directories" higher, to use the information for installing cronjob(s)
+ Added Multi-Instance support for cronjob
* Update to new TS3UpdateScript will just update your CHANGELOG.txt, INSTALL_USAGE_GUIDE.txt and TS3UpdateScript.sh
+ Added support for different serveradmin passwords
! The script will copy the 'password-file' file from the current directory to each TeamSpeak 3 server root directory and will use that file instead of the file from the same directory, where the TS3UpdateScript is located
! You need to run the script once, that the 'password-file' file is copied to each directory: ./TS3UpdateScript.sh --check

==================================
||      Version 3.0 RC5         ||
==================================

* Fixed issue with older egrep versions (egrep: invalid option -- E)
* Adjusted old text for '--inform-online-clients' - password-file and not password is needed as parameter
* Changed "return 0" to "exit 0" in last line of script
* Fixed issue with mktemp for RedHat/CentOS (mktemp: cannot create temp file /tmp/ts3_download_page-XXXXX.tmp: File exists)
+ Added text-files for update messages (auto_update_text.txt and update_text.txt)
! If you want your own information text for online clients, you have to edit these two files
! You need the package/software 'sed', if you want to inform your online clients
* '--inform-online-clients' will now poke each client and not send a global message, because the most users don't read server messages, but pokes for sure
* '--autoupdate=yes' will save all parameters now
* Adjusted waiting time (from 5 seconds to 10 seconds) to check, if TeamSpeak 3 Server is still running
* Fixed issue with package/software check for RedHat/CentOS distributations
+ Added Multi-Instance support (because of high demand)
* Changed outputs of script
* Adjusted '--autoupdate=yes' parameter: password-file will be saved with absolute path and new parameter '--path' will be saved

* Fixed issue with 'ts3server.ini' (it will be used if this file exists)
* '--help' and '-h' do not need root permissions anymore
* Fixed issue with non-displayed question about updating and abort of script instead
* Changed piped to input redirection (better performance)
+ Validating content of password-file (if password is incorrect, it will not try to inform online clients)
* Query-IP address is default '127.0.0.1'; if ts3server.ini exists, it will be used the given query_ip address, if it is not '0.0.0.0'
* ts3server_startscript.sh: COMMANDLINE_PARAMETERS '${2}' will be replaced with 'ts3server.ini', if the ts3server.ini file exists or the MySQL database is used
+ Added option '--path' to set a static TeamSpeak 3 server path
+ Added TS3UpdateScript update function
! You will need a further software package therefore: unzip
* Adjusted software package checks
+ Added feature to set your own poke message sender name: displayed_user_name.txt

==================================

==================================

* Changed cronjob parameters from 'day of week', because 0 means to be sunday and not monday (I've also change the description. I ment AM, not PM.)
* Changed sequence of starting TS3 and TSDNS server (1. TSDNS Server, 2. TS3 Server)
* Changed code of starting TSDNS server, because it searched the config file 'tsdns_settings.ini' in the powered working directory
+ Added INSTALL_USAGE_GUIDE.txt for detailed installation and usage informations
+ Added system detection for Debian and RedHat/CentOS
! Script supports just Debian and RedHat/CentOS systems
* Adjusted package installation status
* Adjusted user and group detection of old files (it should be a bit faster than before)
